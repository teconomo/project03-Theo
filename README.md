  My strengths are definitely working with the git shell even though I started using it at the beginning of this semester. However, if there are things about git that I am not sure of, a quick google search will guide me to a resolution.

	My strengths would probably hover around HTML and CSS. HTML is pretty basic to understand as I had some prior knowledge from highschool. CSS I developed through this semester and I enjoy making a page look stunning and alluring.

  My highest strength is using HTML. I spent a lot of time over the past summer doing my own web projects. I am also pretty good with CSS too, but not at the level of organization the professor may prefer. My weakness is using the git console.
